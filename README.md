Supplemental Movies for the study "A Model-Based Reassessment of the Three-dimensional Tuning of Head Direction Cells in Rats"

# Supplemental Movies Legends:

# Movie S1: 
Animation of the motion protocol in Fig. 6. All protocols are animated in sequence. For each protocol, the movie shows the panels ‘Illustration’, ‘Trajectory’ and ‘Tuning curves’. The mouse head is animated in the panel ‘Illustration’, rotating though the entire trajectory with a brief pause every 45°. An azimuth compass affixed to the head’s horizontal plane (blue), onto which TA is measured, is also animated an continuously updated according to the dual-axis rule. A green line in panels ‘Trajectory’ and ‘Tuning curves’ indicates the position of the head in these panels.

# Movie S2: 
Animation of the motion protocol in Fig. 7, similar to Movie S1.

# Movie S3: 
Animation of the motion protocol in Fig. 8, similar to Movie S1.

# Movie S4: 
Animation of the motion protocol in Fig. 9, similar to Movie S1.
